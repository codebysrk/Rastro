# 🚀 Project Showcase: Rastro | Premium Dining Website

Excited to share my latest project, **Rastro** – a fully responsive, premium restaurant website designed with a focus on modern aesthetics and user experience! 🥘✨

**🌟 Key Features:**

- **Premium UI/UX:** Built with a "Glassmorphism" design system, custom animations, and a rich color palette.
- **Localized Experience:** Tailored for the Indian market with authentic menu items (Hyderabadi Biryani, Idli Sambar), INR currency, and localized content.
- **Performance:** Styles are optimized using **Tailwind CSS CLI** (minified build) for lightning-fast load times.
- **Interactive:** Smooth scroll reveal animations (Intersection Observer), mobile-responsive menu, and engaging hover effects.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**

- **HTML5** (Semantic Structure)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling & Custom Config)
- **JavaScript** (DOM Manipulation & Logic)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)

This project was a great way to dive deep into **Tailwind's advanced configuration**, **responsive design patterns**, and **creating culturally relevant web experiences**.
